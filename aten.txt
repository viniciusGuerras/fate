Vini's N-dimensional array library (FATE -> Fast Tensors)

library -> #include <sys/sysctl.h>
sysctlbyname, is used to get the CPU cores ("logical" and "physical")

TENSOR STRUCTURE
	for the moment, the tensor will have the following components:
		- data = an contiguous array that has all the data.
		- shape = the array has n-dimensions, the shape shows this.
		- strides = used to find de dimensions in the contiguous array.
		- ndim = used to know the number of dimensions.
		- size = total quantity of data in the data array.


TODO - 
	is the new method of code "reusing for operations worth it?
	
	FOR BROADCASTING:
		Each tensor has at least one dimension

		When iterating over dimension sizes, starting at the trailing dimension, the dimension sizes must either be equal, one of them is 1, or one of them does not exist

		-how to implement this?
			i'll have two tensors t1 and t2
			the dimensions of t1 is an m-sized array
			the dimensions of t2 is an n-sized array
			i'll need to get the size of the smallest array
			iterate backwards checking if each dims is equal or one of them 1
			need to expand the smaller array, or do i?

		done

		

			

OLD -
	.the tensors are not multithreading correctly, so the sum isnt working.
	.how to return the summed vector? create a new or use one of the both used?
		- i corrected it by passing a single result tensor.
		- also added memory direct summing (instead of passing the whole tensors
