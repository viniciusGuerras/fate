TENSOR CREATE
	CREATES TENSOR, NEEDS TO CLEAR MEMORY
	PURPOSE: Create a tensor in memory. Must manage memory carefully.
	tensor structure:
	for the moment, the tensor will have the following components:
		- data = an contiguous array that has all the data.
		- shape = the array has n-dimensions, the shape shows this.
		- strides = used to find de dimensions in the contiguous array.
		- ndim = used to know the number of dimensions.
		- size = total quantity of data in the data array.

SCALAR TENSOR
	PURPOSE: Create a 1-element tensor (a scalar).
	How it works:
		1.Use shape [1] and call tensor_create.
		2.Assign the single value to data[0].

BORADCAST SHAPE
	CREATES OUT_SHAPE, NEEDS TO CLEAR MEMORY
	PURPOSE: Compute a shape that can accommodate two tensors for operations.
	picks two tensor dimension shapes and returns the broadcasted one.
		- pick the length of the biggest dimension between the two
		- for each ith position in both:
			- if the ith position doesn't exist: 1
			- else: add the value of the corresponding shape
		- in the case that dim_1 != dim_2 and neither of them is 1, broadcasting isn't possible
		- keep this into an "out" array and return it at the end

TENSOR APPLY BINARY OP
	PURPOSE: Apply a binary operation (like +, -, *, /) element-wise on two tensors with broadcasting support.
	 Steps:
		- Compute broadcasted shape with broadcast_shape.
		- Create the result tensor using the broadcasted shape.
		- Compute broadcasting strides:
			- If the tensor has dimension size 1 in a certain axis: 0.
			- Otherwise: the normal stride.
		- Loop over every element in the result tensor:
		- Compute offsets for each tensor using strides.
		- Apply operation: result[i] = op(t1[offset1], t2[offset2]).
		- Increment multi-dimensional index array (idx) across all dimensions.
		- Free temporary memory.
